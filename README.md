This is a template for new Freeduino, Arduino shields. 
The template is made in KiCAD EDA.

Quick start
-----------
This tool is for building a basic EPROM sheield with ZIF socket for the Arduino
platform.  Many EPROM readers/writers cost $100+ and are only compatible with
Microsoft Windows.  This aims to provide a cross platform, fully open source
replacement.
